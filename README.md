This is our final project for the IS1220BC: "Object Oriented Software Design" class in Centrale-Supélec (2016).
Our teacher was Pr. Paolo Ballarini

Language: Java

Goal: implement using OOP features an online food ordering and delivery platform (similar to Uber Eats)

This project involved building a framework of Classes that enabled different people to interact after they register to the platform:
  - Clients : they can order from a list of restaurant a choice of meals. They can also subscribe to fidelity plans ;
  - Restaurants : they can update their list of meals. They receive the order from the platform ;
  - Delivery boys : after being attributed an order, they receive the adresses of the restaurant and the client ;
  - Manager : they are in charge of the platform. They manage the list of customers, restaurants and delivery boys. They choose the fidelity policies, and the way the order are affected to the delivery boys.
  
 
 Our final report is available in the ___ folder
